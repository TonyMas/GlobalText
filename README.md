Example on how to create global text processing in python

People usually tends to think only in terms of their native language when develop text processing functions.
And then if they get input in other language a lot of interesting things can happen.
It is worth to think about international support on early stages when you wrote any long living code,
to save yourself some nasty surprises later.

Purpose of this notebook is to show several common pitfalls in text processing that needs to be taken care
from international point of view and how someone can work around them.
